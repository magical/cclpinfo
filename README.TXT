Program usage:	datstat datfile [-pth]

Reads a Chip's Challenge file specified by datfile, and displays the level
names and numbers. You can have it display time limit, password, and level 
hints with command-line options.

	p	display the level passwords
	t	display the level time limits
	h	display the level hints

It should be noted that this program does not display pi^2.dat correctly.

The original program was written by Madhav Shanbhag and posted to the Chip's
Challenge newsgroup (annexcafe.chips.challenge) at news.annexcafe.com.
